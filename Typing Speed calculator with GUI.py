    '''In GUI programming, a top-level root windowing object contains all of the little
windowing objects that will be part of your complete GUI application. These can be
text labels, buttons, list boxes, etc. These individual little GUI components are known
as widgets.''',

considered the parent of those widgets. Accordingly, if a widget is contained in another
widget, it‚Äôs considered a child of the parent, the parent being the next immediate enclosing
container widget.''',

or text is filled into a text field. These types of user behaviors are called events, and the
GUI‚Äôs response to such events are known as callbacks.''']
